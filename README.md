# Tokens

An example of exporting token values from a Figma library using [Figma Token](https://docs.tokens.studio/). When synced, a GitHub action is triggered to build Sass partials with mode-specific CSS variables, ready for dev teams to go wild with styles.

## Project goal

Give the design team more control over the atomic elements used throughout a codebase by exporting their library tokens directly to the project repository.

## Inspiration
